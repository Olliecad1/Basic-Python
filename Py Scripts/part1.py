# this is a comment when you run this program this comment wont appear on the screen you do need these comment but most programs have them 
# the reason we have comments is because they are used by the program creator to document what is happening
# so that when someone else picks up the program and they cant understand the code then they will understand because of the comments
# The next line of code is the first that will appear on the screen the print statement
print('Hello everyone')
# the next section of code with be numbers and maths
# Be aware none of maths stuff will work unless you print them out or your using the idle command window for example for the print one see line below
print(1 + 2)
# * is multiply in python 
print(4 * 2)
# / is division in python
print(4 / 2)
# you dont have to do whole numbers you can do fractions
print(4.4 * 2.2)
print(4.2 ** 2.2)
# Variables are nothing but reserved memory locations to store values. This means that when you create a variable you reserve some space in memory.
#Based on the data type of a variable, the interpreter allocates memory and
#decides what can be stored in the reserved memory. Therefore,
#by assigning different data types to variables, you can store integers,
#decimals or characters in these variables.
number = 20
variable = 5 * 5
print(number * variable)
print(3 * 3 / 3)
# some more basic variables
a = 1
print(a)
hello = 'hello'
print(hello)

wrong = 1
b = 1
print('3 is',wrong + b)

print(number * variable)

variable1 = 'Hello'
world = ' world'
print(variable1 + world)
